# Word Clock

## Overview

This project unveils the design and assembly of a distinctive word clock, configured to exhibit time by lighting up letters in a puzzle-like display. A fusion of hardware and software engineering encapsulated in a 9x9 shadow box frame enhances manufacturability. 

## Technical Details

### Specs
- **Display Technology**: Individually addressable WS2812B RGB LEDs illuminate each letter. 
- **Microcontroller**: Driven by the high-performance STM32F4 Microcontroller.
- **Real-Time Clock (RTC)**: STM32 employs a 32.768 kHz external crystal to fine-tune the RTC mechanics.
- **User Interface**: A 4-digit 7-segment display coupled with a pushable rotary encoder allows adjustments for time, color, date, etc.
- **Power Source**: Powered through a USB-C cable, this design merges convenience with modern trends.
- **Enclosure**: Tailored to snugly fit a 9x9 shadow box from Michaels, facilitating seamless integration into diverse decor styles.

### Tools
- **Software Environment**: Leveraging STM32 Cube IDE for the firmware development, this tool stands out for programming STM32 microcontrollers.
- **Hardware Environment**: Altium Designer was employed for all electronic schematics and PCB layouts, guaranteeing top-tier design quality and manufacturability.

## Assembly and Setup

### Building the Clock

1. **Manufacture the Clock**: You'll find the Gerber, BOM, and CPL files for sending to your preferred PCB manufacturer.
2. **Microcontroller Programming**: A 6 pin J link adapter is necessary for programming the microcontroller. Refer to the SWD on the board for the programming interface.
3. **3D Printing**: Certain components are to be 3D printed and assembled using M6 nuts and bolts.
4. **Letter Mask**: Included is a vector file for the mask â€” these letters cater to my specific requirements, yet the design permits custom text display through full customization of a row of letters. This design needs conversion into a vinyl sticker for the front glass application.
5. **Film**: Adding a one-way film to the glass front makes the unlit letters vanish from sight.
6. **Prepare Back Panel**: To accommodate the 7 segment display, the rotary encoder, and the USB-C, the back panel requires laser cutting. I will provide the SVG file used for this purpose shortly.
7. **Assemble**: Commence with a 9x9 diffusion paper layer, followed by the PCB with letters facing the glass, and finally secure the back panel in place.

### Operation

- **Setting the Time**: Utilize the dial to cycle through hours and minutes, pressing it to alternate between selections. The current setting is displayed on the 7-segment display.
- **Powering the Clock**: Simply connect the clock to a power outlet using a USB-C cable, and it will start showcasing the current time.
